// We have assumption that elements of S are positive integers, as well as k
public static boolean subSetSum(List<Integer> S, int k){
    Collections.sort(S);
    int sum = 0;
    for(int s: S){
        sum += s;
        if (sum == k)
            return true;
        if (sum > k)
            break;
    }
    return false;
}
This greedy strategy algorithm works well in some cases but doesn't always.
For example:

It works with : S = {2, 3, 5, 6}, where k is 5 or 10 -It doesn't work: S = {1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15}, where k is 8
